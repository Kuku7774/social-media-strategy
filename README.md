# 📱 Social Media Strategy – Web3 Focused

This folder showcases the real formats, campaign styles, tracking sheets, and content strategy I’ve used as a Social Media Manager for Web3 projects like **Bitfinity, Dmail, Solmoon**, and **GunStart Metaverse**.

It’s a complete stack of what I’ve personally used — from content planning to post-copy, from collab outreach to monthly growth reporting.

## 📂 What’s Inside

### 📅 [`content-calendar-template.md`](content-calendar-template.md)  
A weekly post planning sheet showing how I map X (Twitter), Telegram, and Discord content — including memes, updates, giveaways, and recaps.

### ✍️ [`caption-style-guide.md`](caption-style-guide.md)  
Real-world caption examples, hook formats, and CTA writing I use for product drops, contests, and meme-style posts. With human tone + Web3 vibes.

### 🤝 [`collab-message-template.md`](collab-message-template.md)  
DM templates for reaching out to partners, KOLs, and communities. Friendly, clear messages that work on both X and Telegram — not spammy.

### 📊 [`post-performance-tracker.md`](post-performance-tracker.md)  
Format for tracking how each post performed — likes, RTs, comments, CTR. Includes Telegram + Discord tracking, and tools/bots I use like Statbot & MEE6.

### 📈 [`growth-report-outline.md`](growth-report-outline.md)  
My personal monthly reporting format — shows platform growth, top content, campaign outcomes, and what's working vs what’s next.
