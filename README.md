# 📱 Social Media Strategy – Web3 Focused

This folder showcases real templates and strategic formats I’ve used to plan, post, and measure Web3 social media campaigns across X, Telegram, and Discord.

### 💡 Included Formats:

- 📅 `content-calendar-template.md` – Weekly post plan layout  
- ✍️ `caption-style-guide.md` – Hook, CTA, and post examples  
- 🤝 `collab-message-template.md` – DM templates for partners/KOLs  
- 📊 `post-performance-tracker.md` – Basic tracking sheet format  
- 📈 `growth-report-outline.md` – Monthly summary report style

Use these for inspiration or as direct plug-and-play formats for your brand's content planning and reporting needs.
