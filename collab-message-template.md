# 🤝 Collab Message Templates – Web3 Community / KOL Outreach

These are real-style DM formats I’ve used to reach out to KOLs, partner projects, and tool builders while managing social media and growth at Web3 projects like Bitfinity, Dmail, and Solmoon.

The tone: friendly, direct, not spammy.

## 🧑‍💼 1. Cold DM to a Project (Collab Inquiry)

```
Hey [project name] team 👋

Big fan of what you’re building — especially [mention something specific like “your L2 bridging dashboard”].

I manage social/growth for [your project], and I was wondering if we could explore a simple collab — even if it’s just a co-post, meme battle, or Discord call.

If this sounds interesting, I’d be happy to share a short plan!

No pressure, either way — cheering for your growth 🚀

## 🔗 2. X (Twitter) Reply → DM Format (Warm)

```
Hey [Name], saw your tweet about [topic] — totally agree 👀

I’m part of [your project name] and we’ve been doing some community-focused collabs. Think memes, giveaways, Zealy pushes — low-effort but fun reach boosters 🔥

Would love to jam if you’re open to it — DM’s open.
```

## 💬 3. Telegram Message (Quick Pitch Style)

```
Hey [Name] – quick one:

I work on social/media side with [project name] and we’re doing light collabs with aligned projects.  
Stuff like:  
– Giveaway swaps  
– X tag rounds  
– Zealy push exchanges

Let me know if your team would be open to a casual sync 🙌  
Happy to share examples!

## 💡 Tips for Effective Collab Outreach

- **Be specific** → Mention something real from their project
- **Be short** → No long paragraphs or whitepaper pitches
- **Be human** → Write like you’d talk, not like a press release
- **Don’t oversell** → No begging, just offering shared value
- **Be flexible** → Give 2–3 collab options + open-ended close
