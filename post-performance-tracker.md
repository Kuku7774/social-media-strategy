# 📊 Post Performance Tracker – Web3 Social Media Metrics

This is a basic format I’ve used to track how social media content performs — especially for campaigns, meme pushes, and product updates on X, Telegram, and Discord.

It helps me identify what’s working, when to post, and how to improve CTA & copywriting.

## 🤖 Discord Bots I Use to Track Performance

Tracking reactions, engagement, and message insights inside Discord becomes easier using community-safe bots:

### 🛠 Recommended Bots

| Bot Name   | Purpose                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| MEE6       | Logs reaction count, shows top posts weekly  |
| Statbot    | Tracks message activity, reply heatmaps      |
| Carl-bot   | Reaction logs + role-based engagement stats  |
| Sesh       | For event-based engagement tracking          |

---

### ⚙️ Example Use Case (Statbot)

- Weekly Top 5 active channels  
- Reactions per message  
- Unique poster stats  
- Active hours heatmap

Use `/stat messages`, `/stat top`, `/stat activity` for quick insights.

---

### 🔐 Tips

- Keep bots restricted to `#announcements`, `#giveaway`, `#updates`  
- Use `@role` pings strategically to boost reactions  
- Archive low-performance posts after a week
